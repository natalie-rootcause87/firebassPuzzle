# firebassPuzzle

This is a repo I made to help my friends connect to the firebass db using node. It isn't anythng special - it basically does the same thing a curl command will do. This is not part of the official arg, but feel free to use it to query the firebass db.

## To run the thing:
clone the repo
run npm install
run node ./bin/www
open a web page at localhost:3000 and open the console
