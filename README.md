# firebassPuzzle

This is a repo I made to help my friends connect to the firebass db using node. It isn't anything special - it basically does the same thing a curl command will do. This is not part of the official arg, but feel free to use it to query the firebass db.

If you're coming here from Google Spaces, please send me a link so I can join your space!

## To run the thing:

clone the repo

run npm install

run node ./bin/www

open a web page at localhost:3000 and open the console
